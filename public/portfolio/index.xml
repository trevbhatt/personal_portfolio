      <description>Predicting Scooter utilization Using Machine learning to improve strategic placement of scooters in Austin, TX.
Project description: Now ubiquitous, the electric scooter cruises through bike lanes and sidewalks of every major US city. In order to stay competitive, operating companies need to ensure their scooters or e-bikes are highly utilized. They must ensure that their fleets are in place to meet demand. Using data provided by the city of Austin, TX, I implemented various machine learning strategies to predict optimal fleet distribution.</description>

      <description>Terminal Process Control I traveled across BNSF Railway&#39;s system developing and testing Terminal Process Control (TPC) in BNSF&#39;s major rail hubs. My experience with this project inspired me to pursue a full-time career in data science!
TPC is a modern control system for automatically sorting train cars at classification (hump) yards. 160-ton train cars are rolled down a hill while TPC controls their speed and routes them to a destination. The largest yards process over 2000 cars per day!</description>
