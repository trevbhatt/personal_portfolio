Hi, I'm Trevor. :wave:

While I've worn many hats (literally and figuratively), I'm an engineer at heart--always looking to better understand the world around me.

I've lived in Colorado, Kansas City (both the Kansas and Missouri sides), and eastern Washington. I currently reside in Portland, OR.

I love to travel and explore because I love learning.  You can usually find my wife and me hiking somewhere new, biking, or sipping coffee.

I have over 5 years of experience leading technical and industrial, data based projects.

If you want to join me in finding new and useful ways to understand data and build a better world, let's get in touch at [hire@trevorb.io](mailto:hire@trevorb.io).
